# Instruction Addition Process

## Step 1: ISA Implementation
1. Open `isa.py`
2. Add new instruction to `InstructionType` enum
3. Implement execution method in `InstructionSet` class
4. Add case handling in `execute_step` method
5. Use `logger.py` for operation output
6. Ensure proper error handling and validation

## Step 2: Isolated Test Creation
1. Create new test file in `tests/` directory (e.g., `new_instruction_test.txt`)
2. Include standard header format:
   ```
   ;===============================================
   ; Test Name: [Instruction Name] Test
   ; Description: [Detailed description of test]
   ; Expected Results:
   ;   - Register operations:
   ;     * [Expected register values]
   ;   - Memory operations:
   ;     * [Expected memory values]
   ;   - Cache performance:
   ;     * [Expected cache behavior]
   ;===============================================
   ```
3. Write test cases covering:
   - Basic functionality
   - Edge cases
   - Error conditions
   - Register combinations

## Step 3: Test Verification
1. Run isolated test:
   ```bash
   python main.py tests/new_instruction_test.txt
   ```
2. Verify:
   - All instructions execute correctly
   - Output matches expected results
   - No errors or unexpected behavior
   - Cache behavior is correct

## Step 4: Integration Testing
1. Add new instruction tests to `test_program.txt`
2. Place in appropriate section:
   - Memory Operations
   - Arithmetic
   - Logical
   - Shifts
   - Comparisons
   - Control Flow
3. Run combined test:
   ```bash
   python main.py tests/test_program.txt
   ```
4. Verify:
   - New instruction works with existing instructions
   - No conflicts with other operations
   - Maintains expected behavior in complex scenarios

## Step 5: Documentation
1. Update `instructions.txt` with new instruction details
2. Update TODO.md to mark instruction as completed
3. Document any special considerations or limitations

## Example Test File Structure
```
;===============================================
; Test Name: [Instruction] Test
; Description: Tests [instruction] functionality
; Expected Results:
;   - Register operations:
;     * reg1 = [value] after [operation]
;     * reg2 = [value] after [operation]
;   - Memory operations:
;     * Memory[addr] = [value] after [operation]
;   - Cache performance:
;     * Expected hits/misses for [operation]
;===============================================

; Initialize registers
MOV reg1 #value
MOV reg2 #value

; Test basic operation
[INSTRUCTION] reg1 reg2

; Test edge cases
[INSTRUCTION] reg1 #value

; Test error conditions
[INSTRUCTION] invalid_reg
