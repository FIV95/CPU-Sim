# Future Improvements

## Write-Back Cache Implementation

### Current Limitations
- Write-through policy means every write goes directly to memory
- Cache only provides benefit for read operations
- Not utilizing cache's full potential for write operations
- Unrealistic memory access patterns

### Required Changes

1. ISA Execution (`isa.py`):
   - Modify all memory operations
   - Update register value handling
   - Change memory address operations
   - Revise execution step logic

2. Cache Implementation (`cache/cache.py`):
   - Add dirty bit tracking
   - Implement write-back logic
   - Handle cache line eviction
   - Update write policy implementation

3. Memory Operations:
   - Revise MOV instructions with memory
   - Update LOAD/STORE operations
   - Modify memory access patterns
   - Change data propagation

4. Instruction Set:
   - Consider new cache control instructions
   - Add explicit cache flush instructions
   - Implement memory barrier instructions

5. Test Suite:
   - Update all test files
   - Modify test expectations
   - Add cache flush operations
   - Update performance metrics

6. Logging/Output:
   - Revise operation logging
   - Update cache state display
   - Modify performance statistics

### Benefits
- More realistic memory behavior
- Better cache utilization
- Improved write performance
- Reduced memory traffic
- Better locality of reference

### Considerations
- Major architectural change
- Extensive testing required
- All components need updates
- Significant development effort

### Implementation Priority
- Consider as future enhancement
- Requires careful planning
- Need comprehensive testing strategy
- Should be done as a separate branch

## Split Cache Architecture (Harvard Architecture)

### Current Limitations
- Single unified cache for both instructions and data
- No separation of instruction and data access patterns
- Missing benefits of specialized caches
- Less realistic processor architecture

### Required Changes

1. Cache System:
   - Split L1 cache into Instruction Cache (I-cache) and Data Cache (D-cache)
   - Implement separate access patterns for each cache
   - Create distinct replacement policies
   - Handle instruction fetches separately from data access
   - Track statistics independently

2. ISA Execution:
   - Modify instruction fetch mechanism
   - Update memory access routing
   - Change execution pipeline
   - Handle cache misses differently for instructions vs data

3. Memory Operations:
   - Implement separate paths for instruction and data
   - Update memory access patterns
   - Modify cache coherency
   - Handle instruction prefetching

4. Test Suite:
   - Create separate tests for instruction and data caches
   - Update performance metrics
   - Add new test cases
   - Modify test expectations

5. Logging/Output:
   - Implement separate statistics tracking
   - Update display format
   - Modify performance reporting
   - Change debug output

### Benefits
- More realistic processor architecture
- Better instruction fetch performance
- Optimized cache access patterns
- Reduced cache conflicts
- Parallel access to instructions and data

### Considerations
- Major architectural change
- Complex implementation
- Extensive testing required
- Significant performance impact

### Implementation Priority
- Consider as future enhancement
- Requires careful planning
- Need comprehensive testing strategy
- Should be done as a separate branch

# Cache Line Size Enhancement

## Current Implementation
- Current cache line size is set to 1 byte for both L1 and L2 caches
- This simplification was chosen to:
  - Simplify address calculations and set mapping
  - Work seamlessly with Python's variable handling
  - Make cache behavior more predictable for educational purposes
  - Enable straightforward visualization in the GUI
  - Facilitate easier testing and verification

## Proposed Enhancement
Implement more realistic cache line sizes (e.g., 32 or 64 bytes) to better reflect real hardware.

### Required Changes
1. Cache Implementation:
   - Modify read/write operations for multi-byte lines
   - Update set index and tag calculations
   - Implement partial line fills and evictions
   - Add line buffering for writes
   - Handle data alignment within cache lines

2. Memory System:
   - Update memory access patterns
   - Add address alignment checks
   - Implement burst transfers for line fills

3. ISA Implementation:
   - Modify LOAD/STORE operations
   - Handle data spanning multiple cache lines
   - Add alignment-aware memory access

4. Testing Framework:
   - Update test cases for new address alignment
   - Modify cache hit/miss pattern tests
   - Add tests for multi-byte operations
   - Update set index calculations in tests

5. GUI Updates:
   - Enhance cache block visualization
   - Show multiple values per cache line
   - Update set index display
   - Add line offset visualization

### Benefits
- More realistic simulation of modern cache behavior
- Better demonstration of spatial locality
- More accurate performance modeling
- Closer alignment with real hardware designs

### Considerations
- Increased complexity in implementation
- More complex debugging and testing
- Need for careful handling of Python variables
- Additional educational overhead in explaining line size concepts

### Implementation Priority
Medium - This would be a significant architectural change that would improve realism but requires extensive modifications across the codebase.
