; JNZ Instruction Test
; Tests the Jump if Not Zero (JNZ) instruction functionality
;
; Expected Results:
; - When eax is non-zero, should jump to the specified label
; - When eax is zero, should continue to next instruction
; - Should work with forward and backward jumps
;

; Test 1: Jump when eax is non-zero
MOV eax #5      ; Set eax to non-zero
JNZ test2       ; Should jump to test2
MOV ebx #1      ; Should be skipped
HALT            ; Should be skipped

test2:
MOV ebx #2      ; ebx should be 2 after jump
MOV eax #0      ; Set eax to zero for next test
JNZ skip        ; Should NOT jump since eax is 0
MOV ecx #3      ; Should execute this
HALT

skip:
MOV ecx #4      ; Should not reach here
HALT
