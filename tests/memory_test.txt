;===============================================
; Test Name: Comprehensive Memory Consistency Test
; Description: Tests memory operations and cache-memory interaction:
;   - Memory writes through cache
;   - Direct memory access
;   - Memory consistency after cache evictions
;   - Value verification at all levels
;   - Edge cases and fringe scenarios
;
; Expected Results:
;   Memory Operations:
;   - Values written through cache appear in memory
;   - Values can be read back from memory
;   - Memory remains consistent after cache evictions
;   - Memory values survive cache replacements
;   - Edge cases handled correctly
;===============================================

; Test 1: Basic Memory Write-Through
; Write values through cache and verify in memory
MOV [100] #42   ; Write through L1->L2->Memory
MOV [200] #84   ; Write through L1->L2->Memory
LOAD eax [100]  ; Should be in L1 cache
LOAD ebx [200]  ; Should be in L1 cache

; Test 2: Memory Consistency After Cache Eviction
; Fill cache set to force eviction, then verify memory
MOV [300] #1    ; First value
MOV [364] #2    ; Maps to same L1 set
MOV [428] #3    ; Maps to same L1 set
MOV [492] #4    ; Should cause eviction
; Now verify first value directly from memory
LOAD ecx [300]  ; Should read from memory (L1 miss)

; Test 3: Multiple Writes to Same Location
; Ensure memory has latest value
MOV [500] #10   ; Initial write
MOV [500] #20   ; Update value
MOV [500] #30   ; Update again
MOV [500] #40   ; Final value
LOAD edx [500]  ; Should be 40

; Test 4: Memory Retention After Cache Flush
; Write values, then force cache eviction
MOV [600] #55   ; Write initial value
MOV [664] #66   ; Same cache set
MOV [728] #77   ; Same cache set
MOV [792] #88   ; Force eviction
MOV [856] #99   ; Force more eviction
; Verify original value survived eviction
LOAD esi [600]  ; Should get 55 from memory

; Test 5: Large Memory Range Access
; Test memory consistency across different regions
MOV [1000] #1
MOV [1200] #2
MOV [1400] #3
MOV [1600] #4
MOV [1800] #5
; Force cache misses by reading in reverse
LOAD edi [1800]  ; Should be 5
LOAD eax [1600]  ; Should be 4
LOAD ebx [1400]  ; Should be 3
LOAD ecx [1200]  ; Should be 2
LOAD edx [1000]  ; Should be 1

; Test 6: Memory-Cache Coherence
; Write to memory through cache, then force eviction
MOV [800] #100   ; Write through cache
MOV [800] #101   ; Update in cache
MOV [800] #102   ; Update again
; Force eviction by filling set
MOV [864] #200
MOV [928] #201
MOV [992] #202
; Verify final value in memory
LOAD esi [800]   ; Should be 102

; Test 7: Rapid Memory Updates
; Quick succession of writes followed by read
MOV [1500] #60   ; Initial write
MOV [1500] #61   ; Quick update 1
MOV [1500] #62   ; Quick update 2
MOV [1500] #63   ; Quick update 3
MOV [1500] #64   ; Final update
LOAD edi [1500]  ; Should be 64

; Test 8: Cache Set Conflict Stress
; Force multiple conflicts in same cache set
MOV [1024] #1    ; Set 0
MOV [1088] #2    ; Same set
MOV [1152] #3    ; Same set
MOV [1216] #4    ; Same set
MOV [1280] #5    ; Same set
MOV [1344] #6    ; Same set
; Read back in different order
LOAD eax [1024]  ; Should be 1
LOAD ebx [1152]  ; Should be 3
LOAD ecx [1280]  ; Should be 5
LOAD edx [1216]  ; Should be 4

; Test 9: Write-Back Stress Test
; Multiple writes to same locations
MOV [2000] #1    ; Initial write
MOV [2000] #2    ; Update
MOV [2000] #3    ; Update
MOV [2000] #4    ; Update
MOV [2000] #5    ; Update
; Force eviction with sequential addresses
MOV [2004] #10   ; Next address
MOV [2008] #20   ; Next address
MOV [2012] #30   ; Next address
MOV [2016] #40   ; Next address
; Verify final value
LOAD esi [2000]  ; Should be 5

; Test 10: Memory Boundary Test
; Test memory access near boundaries
MOV [0] #255     ; First address
MOV [4] #254     ; Second address
MOV [8] #253     ; Third address
MOV [12] #252    ; Fourth address
; Read back
LOAD eax [0]     ; Should be 255
LOAD ebx [4]     ; Should be 254
LOAD ecx [8]     ; Should be 253
LOAD edx [12]    ; Should be 252

; Test 11: Cache Line Boundary Test
; Test memory access across cache line boundaries
MOV [64] #1      ; End of first cache line
MOV [68] #2      ; Start of second cache line
MOV [72] #3      ; Second cache line
MOV [76] #4      ; Second cache line
; Read back
LOAD eax [64]    ; Should be 1
LOAD ebx [68]    ; Should be 2
LOAD ecx [72]    ; Should be 3
LOAD edx [76]    ; Should be 4

; Test 12: Memory Consistency Under Load

LOAD ebx [500]   ; Should be 40
LOAD ecx [800]   ; Should be 102
