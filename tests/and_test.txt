;===============================================
; Test Name: AND Instruction Test
; Description: Tests the AND instruction functionality including:
;   - Register to register AND operations
;   - Immediate value AND operations
;   - Bitwise operations verification
;
; Expected Results:
;   - Final register values:
;     * eax = 8 (0b1000, result of 10 AND 12)
;     * ebx = 12 (0b1100, unchanged)
;     * edx = 10 (0b1010, result of 10 AND 15)
;   - Cache performance:
;     * Should show hits for register operations
;     * No memory operations expected
;===============================================

; Initialize registers with test values
MOV eax #10    ; 0b1010
MOV ebx #12    ; 0b1100

; Test AND between registers
AND eax ebx    ; eax = 0b1000 (8)

; Test AND with immediate value
MOV edx #10    ; Reset edx to 0b1010
AND edx #15    ; edx = 0b1010 (10)
